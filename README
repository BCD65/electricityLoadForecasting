In the folder dataPreparation, the main.py script downloads, formats and saves public data from MeteoFrance and RTE websites. The load data and the weather data are saved in two separate multiindexed pandas dataframes. The objective is to have a public dataset that can then be used as the input of forecasting algorithms. In the config.py script, the user can choose between the national load and the administrative regions, the years to download and the folder where the data is saved.
